1. Display a line plot of 100 data, vertically centered (y=0 corresponds to the
   middle of the window) going from left to right

2. Animate the previous plot by generating whole new y data at each new frame.

3. Animate the previous plot by updating only one at at time.

4. Same as above but find a way to (visually) indicate where data is updated.

5. Display two animated signals one on top, one on bottom

6. Display 10 signals on top of each other.

7. Get rid ot spurious lines in the previous example.

8. Animate 100 signals of 500 points each using techniques from 4.
